===================

This code is used to accomplish the task "DP mixture" in Advanced Machine
Learning Course. Currently, I only achive the basic gibbs sampling method,
levaing collapsed gibbs sampling as future work.

I use Matlab because its convinence for concise code, debug, etc. In the
following, I will introduce the (1)directory structure, (2)data generation,
(3)CRP training, and (4)evaluation. Besides, how to run the code is also
included.


Directory Structure
===================
In this part, I will also clarify the main function of each file.

| datasets
    || gendata.m --> generate data to be used in DP mixture model.

| dpmix
    || dpmix.m --> main program, calling other functions to do initialization,
        data generation, CRP inference, evaluation and plotting.
    || dp_crp.m --> one iteration of CRP inference.
    || init_crp_v1.m --> randomly partition data and get clusters.
    || init_crp_v2.m --> similar as above except that this program simulates
        the process of users entering restaurant from the first to the last
        one to get the random partition.

| utilities
    || evaluation.m --> achieves the three evaluation metrics proposed by
        teachers. However, I didn't understand the second metric well.
    || multigaussian.m --> get the probability of points based on Gaussian
        density distribution.
    || randmult.m --> randomly generate samples from multinomial distribution.
    || myplot.m --> output the evaluation results with fiture form.

| fig
    || dataclusters.jpeg --> each data point's category is shown.
    || numclusters.jpeg --> number of clusters in each iteration when training.
    || diffclusters.jpeg --> evaluation metric 1.
    || M_dis1.jpeg --> evaluation metric 2.
    || M_dis2.jpeg --> evaluation metric 3.

How to run code
===============
After starting Matlab and entering the main directory, run the following
commands in order.

1. initpath
2. cd dpmix
3. dpmix


Data generation
===============
I choose the same way as the slides introduces and sample them. Moreover,
users can set related parameters in file 'dpmix.m'.


How to sample Z and fai
=======================
The main procedures are introduced in the slides. From my perspective, I
get the same results based on the following general idea.

For each zi, first give the posterior formulation. Then utilize the conditional
independence to simplify the formulation, i.e., only save the items related
to zi and xi. Moreover, based on multinomial distribution and conjugate prior,
we can get the final results.

For each fai, choose the similar way as above.


Final results
=============
The final results are drawn in figures, which are in the directory 'fig'.
